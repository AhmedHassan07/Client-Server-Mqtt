MQTT protocol is used for communication between client and server as it is secure and a light weight so consuming less banndwidth. its a best protocol for iot devices to communicate with servers.
Alternativerly COAP can be used which is UDP based. XMPP and other like HTTP can also be used. but i found MQTT best among them.

Winson is used for logging purposed.

For unit tests Sinon and Chai are used
